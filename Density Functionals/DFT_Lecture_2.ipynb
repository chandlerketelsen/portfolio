    "\n",
    "Density functionals have useful applications in fields beyond the Electronic Problem: From Superconductivity to Alloys, Nuclear Energy to Geochemistry, Stellar Materials and beyond. This lecture series focuses on the electronic problem to build a foundation in the theory, which will then be applied by the physicist or mathematician to real-world issues as needed. "

    "## Strategy for Computing Observables\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a tradeoff between computing physical observables using a complicated wavefunction $ \\Psi $ with a simple functional, the expectation value integrals, and using a complicated functional with a simplified wavefunction. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an observable $ O(x_i) $ is an observable of an electron in the system. We write using functional notation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ O = O[ \\Psi ] = \\int \\cdots \\int dx_1 \\cdots dx_N \\Psi^*(x_1, \\cdots, x_N) \\sum_{i, j, \\cdots} O (x_1, \\cdots, x_N) \\Psi (x_1, \\cdots, x_N). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "While the form is understandable, it is not usable since we cannot compute and store the wavefunction $ \\Psi $. So we attempt to compute a functional which depends on a simplified function and we call it\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{O}[ v_{ext} ] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "since the system changes only with respect to external forces. \n",
    "\n",
    "### One-Body Number Density\n",
    "\n",
    "Try using a local, one-body functional to write the functional\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ O_1 = \\int \\cdots \\int dx_1 \\cdots dx_N \\Psi^*(x_1, \\cdots, x_N) \\sum_{i} O_1 (x_i) \\Psi (x_1, \\cdots, x_N). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "All electrons $i > 1$ are identical to the first electron $i = 1$ so the sum is replaced with a factor of $N$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ O_1 = N \\cdot \\int \\cdots \\int dx_1 \\cdots dx_N \\Psi^*(x_1, \\cdots, x_N) O_1 (x_1) \\Psi (x_1, \\cdots, x_N) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "By rearranging the seperable integral we arrive at \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ O_1 = \\int dx_1 O_1(x_1) \\cdot N \\int dx_2 \\cdots dx_N \\Psi^*(x_1, \\cdots, x_N)\\Psi (x_1, \\cdots, x_N) $$\n",
    "\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Obstacle: Why we Cannot Proceed\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantities $Q$ like the one-body number density, two-body number density, and one-body density matrix still **cannot be calculated** since we **cannot store the many-body wavefunction** $\\Psi$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: Choose a Different Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid the need for data in $\\Psi$ we admit a different $Q_i$ for every $O_i[Q_i]$. That means we dont *need* the data $\\Psi$ necessarily so long as quantities $Q$ can be measured another way. \n",
    "\n",
    "To proceed, pose the problem as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Find a quantity $Q$ which makes $O_i[Q]$ computable\n",
    "* Compute $O_i[Q]$ for observables we want\n",
    "* Find a way to calculate the $Q$ which functionals $O_i[Q]$ have in common. \n",
    "\n",
    "So now, instead of representing the observable as a functional of the many-body wavefunction\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ O = O[\\Psi] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "we can represent it as a functional of the single-body number density\n",
