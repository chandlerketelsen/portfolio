    "Generally, functionals are a mapping from a space of functions $C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ into the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. Energy of a system is conserved scalar and makes a tombstone example of functionals. Any definite integral is a functional since it can be evaluated to a scalar value. \n",

    "\n",
    "In order to understand the behavior of and manipulate functionals, we need to use derivatives of functionals. These are like the derivatives of functions but are concerned with more generalized function behavior. We are seeking to differentiate functionals \n",

    "with respect to the function $f$. In order to do this, define the arbitrary test function $\\eta(x)$ which introduces a variation to the function $f(x)$. Similar to the ordinary derivative $\\epsilon$ difference quotient\n",

    "so we can fix $f, \\eta$ as constants and allow variations in $ \\epsilon $. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Taylor Series Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "By Taylor expanding the functional with respect to $\\epsilon$ we write the equation\n",

    "\n",
    "### Testing Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional derivatives are independent of the testing function $\\eta(x)$ so we can choose the function $\\eta(x) = \\delta(x - y)$ without loss of generality. The $\\delta$ distribution has a rich history and convenient algebraic properties: \n",

    "$$ \\left. \\frac{dF_y[f + \\epsilon\\, \\delta]}{d\\epsilon} \\right|_{\\epsilon = 0} = \\int dx\\, \\frac{\\delta\\, F[f]}{\\delta\\, f(x)} \\delta(x - y) = \\frac{\\delta\\, F[f]}{\\delta\\, f(y)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is the most intuitive definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Functionals Many Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Any testing function $\\eta(x)$ will be valid, however. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int dx \\frac{\\delta\\, F[f]}{\\delta\\,f(x)} \\eta(x) \\epsilon $$\n",

    "This point of view concerns a functional of many functions with unique variables\n",

    "\n",
    "Generic variation of $F$ is its variation with respect to *all* its variables $f_i$, which implies\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\delta F = \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial f_i} \\delta f_i. $$\n",

    "Suppose the number of variables approaches infinity. Then this sum in $i$ is rewritten as the integral \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\delta F = \\int dx \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta f} \\delta f(x) $$\n",

    "so substitute $\\delta f(x)$ with the test function $\\eta(x)$ times an infinitesimal to recover the definition of functional derivative\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\delta F = \\int dx \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta f} \\eta(x) \\epsilon. $$\n",
